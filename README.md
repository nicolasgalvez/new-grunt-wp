# Howdy.
## This is how I am importing wordpress sites.
Right now I have a bunch of site in production I need to pull down and commit.

I'm sick of ftp.

I'm tired of manually updating databases.

### I got nothing else to say right now.
Yeah. I wish I had a cheese steak. Or maybe a pizza. Stupid salad. Hey, remember this?
